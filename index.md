### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2, was one of my favorites to code because I was curious how the high-low game would be coded/built in C++. There were some bumps at the start of making the functions that used different expressions and statements, but after that, it was cool to get it to work and play a game of high and low that my partner and I built.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2, was another of my favorite labs because I love playing blackjack (no beating), and I have made the code before in Python, but I was curious how it would look in C++. Learning how to write the functions and figure out how to work the code was fun.  It was complicated at times but still enjoyable to figure out.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1, was another of my favorite labs because I wanted to learn how to construct a code for date difference.  At first, building the functions for taking in the dates and subtracting them was complicated, but seeing it all work at the end was terrific.
